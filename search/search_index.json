The main downfall is that the plugin requires a 99$ support fee for every year to access critical functionality that the MNAHC would need. My Calendar ![Screenshot(12).png] (screenshot(12).png) This is a good look for individual needs of the MNAHC as the plugin support a similar view of the calendar that the MNAHC had before. lacking in some of the more indepth abilities of \"The Events Calendar\" it is free and could be very suitable. EventON ![Screenshot(13).png] (screenshot(13).png) This plugin looks spectacular and would fit the \"WOW\" factor of the MNAHC very well. It allows for the insertion of images behind the event placcards and would be a solid visual calendar for the MNAHC. This plugin also has a subscription fee however, so it's something to be aware of. Final thoughts The MNAHC needs a solid and redable calendar. I honestly think that any one of these 3 calendars would fit their mission. with a bit of maintainence the \"EventON\" calendar would be great for their mission.","title":"Calendar Options (Wordpress)"},{"location":"Calendar/#calendar-options-wordpress","text":"This Page is dedicated to the analysis of wordpress calendars for the MNAHC (Minnesota Austin Healy Club )","title":"Calendar Options (Wordpress)"},{"location":"Calendar/#3-calendars-3-options","text":"The Events Calendar ![Screenshot(11).png] (Screenshot(11).png) Originally when working on the MNAHC Website, this was the calendar that Alysha (I'm sorry if I butchered that spelling) and I wanted to use, it allows for great manueverability in the scheduling of events and allows for good looks on both the weekly and monthly scale.

In terms of what went well for me this semester? Literally nothing, but the best way to learn is through getting smashed by your opponent (digital language) and rebuilding yourself in a way that is optimal to fight back. I had plenty of setbacks, FUBAR situations, and rage filled moments, but I learned far more than I ever could have imagined.
